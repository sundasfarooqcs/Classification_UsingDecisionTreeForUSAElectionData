# Classification_UsingDecisionTreeForUSAElectionData
 
Description:

In this Project a decision tree is trained to predict votes of US Congressmen based on their political party
and on other votes they have made in the past. This is based on a data set from the UCI 
dataset(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/congressional+voting+records) repository. The data contains a total of 435 examples,
one for each member of the US House of Representatives. Each example is 
described in terms of 17 attributes (all boolean) including ”party” (democrat or republican) as a class attribute, and 16 other features,
such as ”education-spending” (with values ”y”, ”n”). These are in comma-separated-file format, with the first line in
the file listing the attribute names (separated by commas) and each remaining line in the file giving the values of these
attributes for a single congress person. The decision tree is trained to predict ”party” (democrat or republican) based 
on the 16 votes of the congressperson.
